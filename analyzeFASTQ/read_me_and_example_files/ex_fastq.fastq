General Info
This file illustrates the format of fastq files produced by Nanopore.


File Location and Naming
Nanopore uses the following folder structure:

Experiment_Folder
    |__ Sample_Folder (a particular run)
        |__ Dated_Sample_Folder
            |__ fast5_fail
            |__ fast5_pass
            |__ fastq_fail
            |__ fastq_pass
            |__ other_reports

Nanopore places fastq files in the fastq_fail and fastq_pass folders. 


File Format
The data for each read is saved on 4 lines as follows:
    (1) sequence ID
    (2) read sequence data
    (3) +
    (4) quality score

(1) The sequence ID contains information about the read as well as the run.
    sequenceID: generated by Nanopore, unique to the read.
    runid: generated by Nanopore, unique to the run.
    ch: The number of the channel that read the sequence.
    start_time: The start time of the read. The format is yyyy-mm-ddThr:mn:scZ
    flow_cell_id: This is the ID of the flow cell. It is written on the top of
        the flow cell and manually entered when starting the run.
    protocol_group_id: The name of the experiment. This is also the name of the
        experiment folder.
    sample_id: The name of the sequencing run. This is the name of the sample
        folder.

(2) The read sequence data is the base-called sequence.

(3) A "+" sign.

(4) The per base quality score of the read sequence. It is encoded from 0 to 93 
    using ASCII 33 to 126.
