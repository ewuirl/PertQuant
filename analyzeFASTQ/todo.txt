Analysis process
1. Get data from fastq file
	- Need list of fastq file names?
		- Can read an input txt file of the file names.
	a. open fastq file
	b. read lines from fastq file			read_line_fastq()
		i. sequence ID
		ii. read sequence
		iii. +
		iv. quality score
2. Sequence parsing
	- Split read sequence into sticky end, barcode, and target sequences
	- need file(s) specifying the barcode and target sequences
3. Count up barcode and target sequences.
4. Save counts to an output file


Multiprocessing (version 1)
	Generate empty output txt file
	Read file names from txt file
	Read each file 1 at a time
	Multiprocess the line reading and sequence parsing
		Save counts in variables
		Read save counts from output file and update save counts in output file


Multiprocessing (version 2)
	Generate empty output txt file
	Read file names from txt file
	Multiprocess file processing
		Read each file
		Read the lines and parse sequences
		Save counts in variables
		Read save counts from output file and update save counts in output file
