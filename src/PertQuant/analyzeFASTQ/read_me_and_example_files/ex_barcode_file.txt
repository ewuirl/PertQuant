General Info
This file contains the barcode sequences used in a sequencing run. 


File Location and Naming
This file can be anywhere. If a sequencing run is barcoded, add the path to the
barcode file as an argument in the count_matches_settings text file.


File Format
This file should only contain barcode sequences, and each barcode should be on a 
separate line. The barcodes can be sandwiched by sticky end sequences, but the 
sticky end sequence should be provided in the count_matches_settings text file.
