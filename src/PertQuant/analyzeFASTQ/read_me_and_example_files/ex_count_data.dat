General Info
This file illustrates the format of subsequence count .dat files produced by 
countmatches.py. Each fastq file processed gets its own .dat file.

File Location and Naming
These files are saved in the save folder specified in the countmatches settings
file (see ex_countmatches_settings.txt). .dat file names consist of 
[fastq_name] + [custom_name] + "_counts.dat", where fastq_name is the name of 
the corresponding fastq file, and custom_name is provided as the argument 
save_file to countmatches.py.


File Format
The first line of the file provides the name of the count settings file generated 
by countmatches.py (see ex_sum_count_data_settings.txt). The subsequent lines 
contain the subsequence count data in the following repeating 2+n line format, 
where n is the number of target sequences.
    (1) Nanopore sequence ID information for read 0
    (2) sequence information for read 0
    (n_0) subsequence counts of read 0 for target 0
    (n_1) subsequence counts of read 0 for target 0 complement
    (n_2) subsequence counts of read 0 for target 1
    (n_3) subsequence counts of read 0 for target 1 complement
    ...

(1) The sequence ID contains information about the read as well as the run.
    sequenceID: generated by Nanopore, unique to the read.
    runid: generated by Nanopore, unique to the run.
    ch: The number of the channel that read the sequence.
    start_time: The start time of the read. The format is yyyy-mm-ddThr:mn:scZ
    flow_cell_id: This is the ID of the flow cell. It is written on the top of
        the flow cell and manually entered when starting the run.
    protocol_group_id: The name of the experiment. This is also the name of the
        experiment folder.
    sample_id: The name of the sequencing run. This is the name of the sample
        folder.

(2) The sequence information for a particular read.
    avg_Q_score (float): The base-averaged per base Q score of the read. Look 
        into Phred Quality Score for more information.
    read_length (int): The length of the read.
    barcode_ID (int): The barcode ID of the read. Set to -1 if barcodes were not
        identified.
    has_repeat_error (int): 1 if the sequence has a repeat error, 0 if not. Set 
        to -1 if repeat errors were not identified.

(n) The subsequence counts of the read sequence for the targets. Each target
    gets its own line, and in each line the subsequence counts are separated by
    spaces. The subsequence counts are ordered from smallest to largest 
    subsequence length. For a given subsequence length, the subsequence counts
    are sorted by the index of the starting location of the subsequences, in 
    increasing order.
