General Info
This file illustrates the format of the count settings text file, generated
when countmatches.py is run. It records information about the sequences counted,
as well as the count settings.


File Location and Naming
This file is saved in the save folder specified in the countmatches settings file.
See ex_countmatches_settings.txt for more information. The file name will begin
with "count_settings_".


File Format
This file is divided into 4 sections:
    Targets, Barcodes, Analysis Settings, and Notes

The Targets section provides the number of targets and the target sequences 
    (without sticky ends).

The Barcodes section provides the number of barcodes and the barcode sequences 
    (without sticky ends).

The Analysis Settings section provides the minimum counted subsequence length,
    whether or not repeat errors were handled, a list of repeat sequences, and
    the number of sequential repeat sequences to be considered a repeat error.

The Notes section includes any additional notes about the run or analysis. This
    can be manually entered, or provided as a commandline argument when running
    countmatches.py.
