General Info
This file illustrates the format of summed count files created by sum_count_dat.py.


File Location and Naming
If the data is not binned during summing, these files are placed in the .folder 
containing the .dat files. Files are named as 
[custom_name] + "_all_" + [target_index] + "_counts.txt" for the target sequence and
[custom_name] + "_all_" + [target_index] + "_comp_counts.txt" for the target complement.

If the data is binned, they are placed in a subfolder. File naming consists of 
[custom_name]_[bin_type]-[bin_size]_[target_index] + "_counts.txt" for the target sequence and
[custom_name]_[bin_type]-[bin_size]_[target_index] + "_comp_counts.txt" for the target complement

File Format
If the data is not binned during summing, all the subsequence counts are on one 
line. If the data is binned during summing, each bin gets its own line. In each 
line the subsequence counts are separated by spaces. The subsequence counts are 
ordered from smallest to largest subsequence length. For a given subsequence 
length, the subsequence counts are sorted by the index of the starting location 
of the subsequences, in increasing order.
