General Info
This file illustrates the format of a nonunique subsequence text file, generated
if record is set to True in the countmatches settings file.


File Location and Naming
This file is saved in the save folder specified in the countmatches settings file.
See ex_countmatches_settings.txt for more information. The file name will end in
"_nonunique_subseq.txt".


File Format
countmatches.py creates target_list, a list of target sequences and their 
complements, and barcode_list, a list of barcode sequences and their complements.
These lists have the following format:
    target_list: [target0, target_comp0, target1, target_comp1, ...]
    barcode_list: [barcode0, barcode_comp0, barcode1, barcode_comp1, ...]

t1 and t2 are the indices of the sequences in target_list that have a shared 
    nonunique subsequence.
t1 and b are the indices of the sequences in target_list and barcode_list that 
    have a shared nonunique subsequence.
b1 and b2 are the indices of the sequences in barcode_list that have a shared 
    nonunique subsequence.
j is the index of where the subsequence starts in the first sequence. 
nonunique_subseq is the nonunique subsequence.
